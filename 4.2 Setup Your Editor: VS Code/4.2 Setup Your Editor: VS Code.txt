-> introduction  
   -> what's free, open-source, and super useful?  
      -> it's a good ol' free integrated development environment (ide)  
      -> ides give you a place to type your code into and try executing it  
      -> in this lesson, you'll learn about vs code, how to install it, and helpful flask vs code extensions  

-> why use vs code?  
   -> in this python + flask course, you will be working with the lightweight vs code ide  
   -> advantages of vs code include:  
      -> free and open-source  
      -> extensions (also free) that make web development easier (e.g. syntax highlighting for django templates)  
      -> broad community support  
      -> integrated debugging and seamless use of your terminal  
   -> if you have a different favourite code editor, feel free to use it instead  
      -> this course will use vs code throughout, so it will be easier to follow along if you choose the same editor  
   -> vs code has rightfully gained a lot of positive attention and is a useful tool to know  

-> install vs code  
   -> to get up and running, please follow codingnomads' vs code installation guide, then return here  

-> vs code extensions  
   -> once you have your text editor installed and set up, install the following extensions to aid in your flask web app development quest:  
      -> **jinja**: jinja template language support for visual studio code  
      -> **jinja2 snippet kit**: jinja2 snippets for cool attractive people to use in your html templates  
      -> **python**: linting, debugging (multi-threaded, remote), intellisense, jupyter notebooks, code formatting, refactoring, unit tests, snippets, and more  
      -> **trailing spaces**: highlight trailing spaces and delete them in a flash  
      -> **autotrim**: automatically trims trailing whitespace when moving the cursor from one line to another  

-> additional settings  
   -> there's also a file auto-save feature in vscode's settings  
      -> to toggle it, head to **file -> preferences -> settings...** and search for "files: auto save"  
   -> for normal users who want to save their files manually every once in a while, this feature is not recommended  

-> now that you've got your code editor set up, it's time to download the lab used in this course
