# CodingNomads-Flask-4-Testing-Environment
## Repository File Tree
This repository contains my work for the 4th module in the [Coding Nomads Flask Web Framework](https://codingnomads.com/course/python-flask-web-framework) course. I completed this 21-module course as part of my independent learning, to invest in my Python skills. I produced an in-depth library of resources on this module, whose file tree is provided below.

## Library Contents
### Blue
I saved course material as pdf files (.pdf extensions) and made notes on these. I next made summary notes, by recording voice memos of Siri reading my written notes out (Voiced Notes.mp4a) and [created word clouds](https://wordart.com/create) out of these (Word Cloud.png). These word clouds were combined into a giff, to visually represent module content.
